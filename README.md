Yggdrasil, a mythological norse tree, a bridge that connects the Nine Realms. 
Although not historically correct, I like to think of it as a tree of immense knowledge

Project Yggdrasil was created to be an assorted library for all books techonology related, the amassed collection of books is gradually and continously being sorted and updated.

This little project had been in planning stages for quite sometime, it was only on the 7th of October, 2020, where I finally had the time to start working on this project. 
This little idea has been in the works throughout late highschool, only getting around to creating a GitHub repository foolishly during my HSC but after graduation.
COVID-19 had been a great motivator for this project, as It allowed the perfect excuse for me to stay home and amass this collection of books. A giant portion of which still remains unsorted.
